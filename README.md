# Leveraging MLOps and Azure OpenAI for Targeted Marketing: Contoso Bank's Journey to Expand Borrower Base

Contoso Bank is undergoing a comprehensive digital transformation across all its departments to enhance its operational efficiency and customer engagement. Currently, the bank's customer base is predominantly composed of liability customers (depositors), while the asset customer base (borrowers) is relatively smaller. The bank aims to rapidly expand its asset customer segment to generate additional revenue through loan interests.

In the previous quarter, the bank launched a marketing campaign targeting potential borrowers, which resulted in an average conversion rate in the single digits. As part of its digital transformation strategy, the marketing department seeks to design more effective campaigns that leverage targeted marketing techniques. The goal is to significantly increase the conversion ratio to double digits while maintaining the same budget as the last campaign. This initiative is pivotal for driving growth and maximizing the bank's profitability through increased borrowing activity.
